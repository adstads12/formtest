           <div class="imagedes">What I've used to create and edit the image above was a<br> graphical image software called Adobe Photoshop.
            Adobe Photoshop <br>is Bitmap graphical softwares which can be used to create or edit images. I recommend to use Adobe Photoshop due to the<br> variety of tools available to edit/create images.   However, the negative aspect of <br>Photoshop is that it requires users to pay (unlike<br> pixlr) and can be hard for beginners to learn on how to use the software. I created this image by creating an image of a horse by using a<br> pencil.  I then used the PolygonalLasso Tool to create the Poly effect and made each triangle <br>on the background have its own colour creating a black/purple/green and blue effect. I created <br>a star which I then copied and pasted two times and grouped them.The file format I used for this picture is a .png. <br> I used this format as the resolution of the image is higher <br>conpared to a .jpeg format which I could of chosen and the .png format stores a high image quality<br> compared to most Bitmap formats.The image resolution is 243x215px causing the image quality <br>to be low and this causes the image to take up less disk storage. The Lossless compression <br>was used for this file format, which is an advantage because the image quality hasn't decreased.<br> Also the image depth is 32 bit causing the file size to be large (taking up more disk <br>space) however, this causes the image quality to be high and a variety of colours to be displayed. However as the image resolution<br> is low and the poly affect of the image reduces the file <br>size this generally means the image quality doesn't take up a lot of memory of 72kb. The Copyright law determines how <br>the material created by the owner can be used and users can identify <br>the owner by looking at the contact details of where the image was originated. For other users to be able to use the owners<br> material, they will need to contact the owner and grant permission. This <br>prcess is done because the creater of an iage would of taken time and money to create an<br> image/material and would need asked for this matter. Copyright free allows users to use the<br> material without asking the owner and can be found where stated. </div>

           <div class="Adamdesc">What I've used to edit the image above was a website called Pixlr. Pixlr is a photo editors website with features and<br> tools available similar to Bitmap graphical softwares. I recommend to use Pixlr due to the <br>tools available to edit/create images with no payments required. However, the negative aspect of<br> Pixlr, is even though it has many features, compared to graphical softwares such as Adobe<br> Photoshop and Adobe Anime, it lakcs with some features which are available in Photoshop and some many <br>features on Photoshop are not in Pixelr due to Pixelr being a free photo editor. The <br>tools I used in Pixlr to edit the image above was the crop tool (grouped then cutted the ungrouped area of <br>the image), erase tool, colour picker tool. I captured the image by using the <br>Camera on my mobile phone. I then used a USB which was connected to my phone to a P.C which I then copied and <br>pasted the image to the P.C. The file format I used for this picture is a .png. I used this <br>format as the resolution of the image is higher conpared to a .jpeg format which I could of chosen and<br> the .png format stores a high image quality compared to most Bitmap formats.The<br> image resolution is 1944x2855px causing the image quality to be high however, this causes the <br>image to take up more disk storage.
